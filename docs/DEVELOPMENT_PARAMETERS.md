## Documentation Reference

This configuration is based on the 16 consolidated documentation files in the project. See [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) for complete navigation.

**Essential files:**
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Architecture of 9 phases
- [README.md](README.md) - Quick start
- [API.md](API.md) - API Documentation
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - Security policy
- [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) - Known issues
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - Change history

## Fundamental Parameters

### Absolute Rules

1. **Documentation**: Always read all .md files in `/docs/` before starting work
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency across all documentation
3. **Updates**: Update documentation after each significant change
4. **No Deletion**: Never delete documentation content without explicit request
5. **Confirmation**: Request confirmation for any deletion with: "Are you sure you want to delete [content]? This action is irreversible."
6. **No Duplication**: Never duplicate actions or content between files
7. **Structure Optimization**: Keep one file per function/subject
8. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive, consistent file names
9. **Precision**: Document precisely; consider users as engineers
10. **Error Tolerance**: Zero tolerance for errors in logic
11. **Questioning**: Question approaches, propose optimal alternatives
12. **Initiative**: Take initiatives, propose ideas, anticipate needs
13. **Jarvis Commands**: When "start jarvis" command, immediately launch complete system and verify
14. **Container Management**: Always check container state before recreation; use "docker start" for existing containers
15. **Consistency Verification**: Always verify cross-references and links after changes

### Strict Documentation Rules

- Never delete existing content
- Always add to existing files
- Always date changes
- Maintain coherence between all .md files
- Document bugs in [BUGS.md](BUGS.md)
- Document changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- Update technical documentation as appropriate
- Avoid duplications
- Optimize structure
- Use consistent naming
- Remember all information for context adaptation
- Follow discussion threads and incomplete tasks
- Generate clean, structured, robust code with documentation
- Provide complete diagnostics on failure

### Security Protections

- Double verification: Always re-read .md files after modification
- Cross validation: Verify modifications are coherent
- Complete history: Document ALL actions in CHANGELOG.md
- Duplication detection: Scan all files to avoid duplicates
- Continuous optimization: Improve structure and coherence
- Complete logging: Full traceability of all actions
- Critical confirmation: Never take critical decisions without explicit confirmation
- Contextual detection: React according to context

### Reference Files

Consult these files according to context:
1. [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) - Navigation and overview
2. [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) - Development guidelines
3. [DEVELOPMENT_PARAMETERS.md](DEVELOPMENT_PARAMETERS.md) - This file (core rules)
4. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Architecture 9 phases
5. [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) - Known issues
6. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - Change history
7. [API.md](API.md) - API Documentation
8. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - Security policy

### Permanent Objectives

- Maintain documentation coherence
- Preserve complete history
- Facilitate maintenance and development
- Prevent information loss
- Guarantee modification traceability
- Eliminate duplications and redundancies
- Optimize structure for better readability
- Maintain consistent naming
- Adapt behavior according to interaction memory
- Anticipate future needs
- Continuously improve proposed solutions

### Anti-Duplication Rules

- Before creation: Check that similar file doesn't exist
- Before writing: Check that content isn't already present elsewhere
- On duplicate found: Merge content keeping most complete/useful
- Report duplicates: Inform if duplicate content detected
- Propose optimization: Suggest structure improvements if necessary

### Expert Engineer Behavior

- Self-analysis: Analyze own responses and propose improvements
- Questioning: Systematically question proposed approaches
- Alternatives: Always propose multiple solutions with advantages/disadvantages
- Proactive correction: Immediately correct detected logic errors
- Initiative: Propose non-requested but relevant ideas
- Anticipation: Predict future needs based on context
- Contextual memory: Adapt behavior according to interaction history
- Technical excellence: Aim for perfection in each solution
